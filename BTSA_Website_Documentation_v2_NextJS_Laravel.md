## First Project: Liberia Youth Empowerment & Housing Initiative

### Project Overview

**Location:** Monrovia, Liberia 🇱🇷  
**Duration:** 6 months (January - June 2026)  
**Budget:** $26,000 USD

### The Challenge

Liberia faces a critical youth crisis following decades of civil conflict and the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic. A generation of young people - colloquially known as "Zokos" (disadvantaged youth) - lack access to education, skills training, and economic opportunities. Many have turned to substance abuse, leaving them marginalized and stigmatized.

Simultaneously, Liberia's construction sector relies on outdated, environmentally harmful building methods. Sustainable alternatives like hydrofoam brick technology remain unknown outside of Firestone Liberia industrial operations.

### Our Solution: Three-Part Intervention

**1. Skills Training Program (6 weeks)**
- Hydrofoam brick production technology
- Sustainable construction techniques
- Business and entrepreneurship skills
- Safety certification
- **Outcome:** 20 certified builders with rare, marketable skills

**2. Practical Application (6 weeks)**
- Trainees build the Empowerment Center under supervision
- Hands-on experience with real construction project
- Quality control and professional standards training
- **Outcome:** Completed community facility built by beneficiaries

**3. Economic Integration (Ongoing)**
- Starter tool kits for each graduate
- Job placement support
- Business cooperative formation assistance
- Ongoing mentorship and alumni network
- **Outcome:** Sustainable livelihoods and community economic development

### Technology: Hydrofoam Brick Innovation

**What is Hydrofoam?**
A revolutionary eco-friendly building material combining cement, sand, and chemical foaming agents to create lightweight, highly insulated blocks.

**Why Hydrofoam for Liberia?**
- **Cost-effective:** 30-40% cheaper than traditional concrete blocks
- **Energy-efficient:** Superior thermal insulation (cooler buildings without AC)
- **Eco-friendly:** Recycled materials, low carbon footprint, reduced deforestation
- **Durable:** 50+ year lifespan, water-resistant
- **Fast construction:** Lightweight, larger blocks = faster building
- **Rare skill:** Only Firestone workers have this expertise in Liberia = high employability

**The Machines:**
Engr. Henrique Crusoe is donating:
- 1 professional hydrofoam brick manufacturing machine
- 1 concrete block machine (for comparison training)
- Molds and auxiliary equipment

Estimated value: $15,000+

### Pan-African Collaboration

**Ugandan Volunteer Team:**
3-5 skilled trainers traveling from Uganda to Liberia:
- Construction supervisors
- Community mobilizers
- Project documentation specialists

**Local Partnership:**
Collaborating with Liberian youth organizations for:
- Participant identification and vetting
- Psychosocial support services
- Community engagement
- Post-program job placement

### Expected Impact

**Immediate (6 months):**
- 20 youth trained and certified
- 1 Empowerment Center completed (serves 100+ community members)
- Technology transfer (hydrofoam expertise in Liberia)

**Medium-term (1-2 years):**
- 15+ graduates employed in construction sector
- 5+ start their own building businesses
- Empowerment Center hosts ongoing training programs
- 50+ additional youth trained by program graduates

**Long-term (3-5 years):**
- Shift in Liberian construction toward sustainable methods
- Reduced youth drug dependency in project area
- Economic revitalization through construction jobs
- Model replicated in other Liberian communities

### Monitoring & Evaluation

- Monthly progress reports with photos and videos
- Quarterly impact assessments
- Tracer studies of graduate employment (6, 12, 24 months)
- Community feedback surveys
- Environmental impact measurement (carbon offset, materials used)
- Financial transparency reports (100% of budget tracked)

  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0)
  const percentage = Math.min((raised / goal) * 100, 100)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Animate progress bar
    const timer = setTimeout(() => setProgress(percentage), 100)
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }, [percentage])
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div className="flex justify-between text-sm">

        <span className="text-muted-foreground">
          {formatCurrency(goal)} goal
        </span>
      </div>
      
      <Progress value={progress} className="h-3" />
      
      <div className="flex justify-between text-sm">
        <span>{Math.round(percentage)}% funded</span>
        <span>{donorCount} donors</span>
